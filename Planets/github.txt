1. The command “pwd” will let us know which directory we’re currently working in.
2. To see our files, we should type “ls”. We should see “patterns.txt” and “symmetry.py” open.
3. To change it you would need to run “nano patterns.txt”
4. To open up “pattern.txt” just to view it, running “cat patterns.txt” will open it.
5. N/A
6. To move “patterns.txt” to calculus folder, we would run “mv ~/music/patterns.txt ~/math/calculus/”
7. To remove the file from geometry, we would run “rm ~/math/geometry/triangle.txt”
8. To move straight to math from music to math would be “cd ../math”
9. To initialize a local git repository, we would run “git init”
10. To connect this to a remote repository we would run “git remote add origin <the url of the remote repository>
11. To copy symmetry from music to math, we would run “cp ~/music/symmetry.txt ~/math/”
12. “Git status” will tell us the current state of our working directory.
13. “Git add symmetry.txt” adds only the symmetry, and “git add .” will add everything.
14. Once added to the staging phase, git is now tracking it. To take it out of staging phase, we would need to run “git reset HEAD symmetry.txt”
15. “Git commit -m “[insert message]”” allows us to commit the changes.
16. We would run “git push origin master”. If we wanted to push to a different branch, we would change master to whatever the branch name we want to push to is called. If we don’t do this, the changes won’t end up in the correct spot in our working directory.
17. To create a new branch we would run “git branch applied_math”
18. To go inside that branch, we would run “git checkout applied_math”
19. We would run these 3 in sequence “git add physics/ → git commit -m “Add physics directory to remote” → git push origin applied_math”. If we switch back before committing, the change made in applied_math won’t be present in the original branch.
20. We would run “git branch”. The green one is the branch we are currently working in. 
21. To move back to our original branch, we would run “git checkout master”
22. To combine applied_math with our original branch, we would run “git checkout master → git merge applied_math”
