# "A temperate super-Jupiter imaged with JWST in the mid-infrared"





# The main point is that this is successful imaging of a giant exoplanet, Epsilon Indi A. The planet is also significantly cooler than other imaged
# exoplanets at around 275K, which goes well with temperature/chemical simulation models that hadn't been tested yet. 
# I believe the source can be trusted. In general (something I saw in my 7A class as well) we're forced to make many assumptions, so we can only ever
# be so accurate.
# They only rely on models and using statistics to rule out possibilities instead of having 100% certainty. In a sense this method is more economical,
# but it can lead to more errors.
