# The regular python function is faster this time around. I am not sure why it is, however if I had to guess I would say it's because every time we 
# run the Numpy function we have to call np.power and np.sqrt each time, which may slow down the process. If this is true, this means that Numpy functions
# are better when we don't have to run simple calculations over and over again (but to me this doesn't make much sense because we use Numpy with for 
# loops all the time).
