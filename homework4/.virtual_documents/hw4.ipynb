# I'm unsure why the test case should give 60 (maybe it's a typo and should be multiplied by 4).
# Regardless, I wanted to set up an array, but replacing the variable as the function runs instead of appending seemed easier.
# In this way, I can make the function run smoothly in one go instead of always going back to the "home variable".
