# by itself or by another list, and we cannot multiply a list by another list and affect specific elements inside the list.

# With arrays, we can affect each element in it, by multiplying, dividing, adding, or subtracting by a scalar or another array. We can even do it with

# I took inspiration from the array-slicing part

array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Example 1: Slicing from one start index to one end index 

print(array[1:5]) # This is to get some aspects of the array you need within a range for example from the 1st element (which is the second) to the 5th (which is the 6th).
print(array[2:3]) # This shows that the first entry is inclusive but the second entry will be left out, which is why there's only one output with this command

# Example 2/3: Slicing from a start index to the very end of an array

print(array[2:]) # This will return our array sliced from the second element (inclusively) to the end of the array
print(array[:2]) # This will return our away but this time sliced from the beginning (0th index) until the second element (exclusively)

# Example 4: We can also slice from negative values

print(array[-1:]) # This is essentially the same thing as saying "return the last element of the array". The last element is the -1 element
print(array[-3:-1]) # This will start at i = -3 (third from last) and go until the last element

# Example 5: We can also slice with a step in between

print(array[0:-1:2]) # This means to return elements of the array starting from the first element to the last but with a step of 2 in between
print(array[::2]) # You can also do this same thing with this simpler call which like for example 2/3 will take the entire array without mentioning the start and stop indeces.


two_d_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]])

# Example 6: We can also slice elements from a nested list:

print(two_d_array[1, 0:3]) # This syntax means to take the 0th and 3rd element from the second list, but we can also make it from both lists:
print(two_d_array[:, 0:3]) # This syntax, similar to example 2, 3, 5 means from all arrays, take the 0th and 3rd element, but we can also add a step
print(two_d_array[:, ::2]) # This means we take all "sub-arrays" in our bigger array and we return all elements with a 2 step.





# I think the example that helped me the most understand the slicing is example 2/3/4 and 5. The reason for this is those seem to be the base of what 
# I needed to know to understand slicing, because once you know this you can just extrapolate and use it for nested lists. Being able to know how the 
# indexing in an array works was very useful to know how to manipulate arrays and affect only certain elements of an array

# In astrophysics class we went over what it would take for a spaceship with some speed V and mass M to make it out and "escape" the gravitational
# pull of the planet it's trying to escape from. To do this, I want to make a function that calculates the kinetic energy of the spaceship based on
# its mass and its velocity, the gravitational potential energy of the planet based on mass and radius, and see if the spaceship could escape. It's a 
# pretty basic function, however it's something that would save me a lot of time on calculations. Another function I wanted to run was plotting the 
# graph for Planck's constant. 





# I think the most challenging part is not being able to run test cases in the module itself. What I ended up doing most of the time is I would copy
# and paste the functions I built in the module into a separate jupyter notebook to test them out and see if they worked. I also forgot a few times to
# reload the kernel after making some changes to the module which made it incredibly frustrating when I was getting the same output for vastly 
# different inputs. Learning that I had to re-import the module after making a change was frustrating was useful.
