Installation
============

From source
-----------

Clone the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/MovingUniverseLab/BAGLE_Microlensing.git bagle

Install required modules::
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install astropy
    pip install celerite
    pip install ephem
    pip install pymultinest
    
Build and install using the command line inside your cloned repo::

    python setupy.py install

Or you can use the source in place (for development) by adding to your
$.bash_profile$::

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/code/python/bagle/src

In the future, we hope to support installation using pip and conda.
